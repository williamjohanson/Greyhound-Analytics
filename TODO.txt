Define key race details
- Location
- Distance

Save files to folders based on track and date!

Get box stats from greyhounds NZ??

Create spreadsheet to track data.

Improve the weighting.


- Do another func which then does recent performance which i assume will be trickier. Again using a dict to update{greyhound object: its weighting}
sum all weightings / its own weighting ???

- Then final func compares them all and gives relative to the other dogs a chance.


Print this all to the screen and also to a new csv file each time so have a tracking of the analysis when it occured.

Can then compare that to the results and i dont know how to compare what actually happened to what happens as there is so many weighting combinations to arrive at the same answer??

Do you keep iterating through until the weightings used matches the result?? Feel like this could continue to fluctuate dramatically rather than slowly (I control) towards the solution.
Or is it just a controller???? Rate of change plus sum of changes plus proportional change??>??? is it just control oooh wee that will be fun. 

Is this then works then maybe tidy new and old code into different folders?? 

- Sort class data into relative ratios.
- Reconfigure weighting value and csv file.
- Wait for races to make sure the storing in text files actually works.
- Calculate a value for each dog.

- Output a race file for each analysis to then compare to the results??


---------OLDER TODOS NOT SO RELEVANT.
----Ensure 9 and 10 are going into right boxes.

- Tidy the variable names currently overlap like crazy.

- Create classes for track, trainer. Maybe just needs to be variables that can access for analysis.

- Read through historical data.

- Create web scraper to get the historical data first?

- Create result.txt files for each race for machine learning and then output to .csv

- Output expected vs results to .csv

- Comparison of odds? Code to determine profitability.

- Bot to start placing the bets for me?



Repeat for other racing.

- Should be creating a JSON/API of all my doggo race data???
