# Greyhound-Analytics
Beginner Analytics Code. 

Takes a web scraper (selenium - probably not the most effective method) and scrapes the HTML code for the extended form files.
Using an HTML conversion, save the relevant data for each dog to its class attributes.
Using weightings for each input, create an output dog rating.
Compare the rating to other dogs in the race to get a value.

Next Step:
--- Using a recurring ML algorithm, improve the weightings to truly reflect what occurs. ---
